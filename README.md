## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ Image upload
- 🧠 CNN-based ResNet model for disease prediction
- 💳 Integrated payment gateway
- 📄 Diagnostic result with downloadable PDF report
- 🔒 Simple and secure user authentication

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

User → Image Upload → ResNet Inference → Payment → Result Display & PDF
